# Scholarship_prediction
The model leverages data from historical records to identify patterns and correlations that can help in making accurate predictions.

This repository contains a scholarship prediction project that utilizes machine learning models and Fast API to predict the likelihood of a student receiving a scholarship. The project includes a web interface built using Streamlit where users can input data and get predictions from different machine learning models. The predictions are made by a Fast API app which serves the machine learning models as APIs.

Key Features:
Data Processing: Ingests and preprocesses data like GPA, test scores, and financial need.
Model Development: Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) with hyperparameter tuning for optimal accuracy.
API Deployment: Deploys the model via FastAPI.

Use Cases:
Educational Institutions: Automates scholarship identification.
Students: Offers insights into scholarship chances.
Counselors: Aids in advising students with predictive analytics.

Technical Stack:
Language: Python
Framework: FastAPI
Libraries: scikit-learn
This solution combines machine learning and FastAPI to streamline scholarship predictions for students and institutions.
